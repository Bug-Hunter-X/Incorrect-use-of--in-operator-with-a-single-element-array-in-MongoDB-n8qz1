# Incorrect Use of $in Operator in MongoDB with Single-Element Arrays

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing only one element.  The `$in` operator is designed to match documents where a field's value is present within a provided array. However, if the array only has one element, a simpler query is more efficient and avoids potential confusion.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect use of the `$in` operator.  It attempts to find documents where the 'field' matches a single value within an array. This is less efficient and potentially incorrect.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach. Instead of using `$in` with a single-element array, it directly compares the field to the value using standard equality operators, which is cleaner and more efficient.

This repository is intended to illustrate the common mistake and provide a more efficient solution for querying MongoDB with single-element arrays.
